todo engine:
- gamepad d-pad like sticks should allow 2 directions at the same time (diagonals)
- camera
- tiled backgrounds with reversed individual tiles
- need to round the positions due to rendering issues (round them in Sprite?)

final things:
- music

todo:
- tier3 scrap sprites
- menu buttons focus?

+ maybe make choices in menu more human readable
- replace gamepad icons in game
- maybe add servant drone somehow
