todo engine:
- gamepad d-pad like sticks should allow 2 directions at the same time (diagonals)
- camera
- tiled backgrounds with reversed individual tiles
- need to round the positions due to rendering issues (round them in Sprite?)
- anim like 1-2-3 played as progression 1-2-3-2 in a loop

final things:
- music

todo:
- add fullscreen option (disable/enable windowed mode)
- menu buttons focus?
- don't clone non-combat units that exceed 20% population
- show enemy bases on the radar
- base should check landing zone before landing
- rework action delay (same action vs other action)
- flamer explosions should be above their target
- make evolution recycle workers that use 50%+ population?

tech debdt:
- fix agent traversal, universal slice seems untraversed in walk/find functions
