todo engine:
- gamepad d-pad like sticks should allow 2 directions at the same time (diagonals)
- camera
- tiled backgrounds with reversed individual tiles
- need to round the positions due to rendering issues (round them in Sprite?)
- anim like 1-2-3 played as progression 1-2-3-2 in a loop

todo:
- crawlers should not walk through the base
- base selector is hidden by shadow
- hide base diode when it flies
- falling base should have damaged shader applied too
- new crawlers are graphically above the flying base
- send nearby crawlers to save the boss if it is under attack
- if base can combine flamers, it always does that due to the lowest evo cost; needs to be fixed
- visual effect when unit is hit (becomes brighter for a split second)
- display boss hp
- check why drones don't like to mine ore
- add fullscreen option (disable/enable windowed mode)
- menu buttons focus?
- show enemy bases on the radar
- base should check landing zone before landing
- rework planner action delay (same action vs other action)
- make evolution recycle workers that use 50%+ population?
- is morale damage even viable?
- render big stone tiles separately (so they don't collide with other tiles like walls)
- show upkeep while flying
- maybe group resources into clusters to speedup collision checking?

iskander:
- maybe add servant drone somehow (hard mode only)
- make base prefer using green cloners
- implement pause?
- make tab smooth
- esc for menu, not exit right away
