todo engine:
- gamepad d-pad like sticks should allow 2 directions at the same time (diagonals)
- camera
- tiled backgrounds with reversed individual tiles
- need to round the positions due to rendering issues (round them in Sprite?)

- maybe make produced drone to always have the last choice faction?

final things:
- music

todo:
- tier3 scrap sprites
- shadow for t3 could be too small
- menu buttons focus?
- update tutorial texts (wait for Oleg proof-reading)
