todo engine:
- gamepad d-pad like sticks should allow 2 directions at the same time (diagonals)
- camera
- tiled backgrounds with reversed individual tiles
- need to round the positions due to rendering issues (round them in Sprite?)
- anim like 1-2-3 played as progression 1-2-3-2 in a loop

todo:
- visual effect when unit is hit (becomes brighter for a split second)
- display boss hp
- check why drones don't like to mine ore
- add fullscreen option (disable/enable windowed mode)
- menu buttons focus?
- show enemy bases on the radar
- base should check landing zone before landing
- rework planner action delay (same action vs other action)
- make evolution recycle workers that use 50%+ population?
- repellers are not cloned because universal agents slice is not handled properly
- is morale damage even viable?
- draw only a piece of tiled bg that fits camera?
- if resource is dry, to not land to pick it up

tech debdt:
- fix agent traversal, universal slice seems untraversed in walk/find functions

iskander:
- maybe add servant drone somehow (hard mode only)
- make base prefer using green cloners
- implement pause?
- make tab smooth
- esc for menu, not exit right away
oleg:
- flamer projectile
