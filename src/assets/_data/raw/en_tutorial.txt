##tutorial.title1 : Tutorial 1 - Basic Colony Operations
##tutorial.description1
Learning topics:

>> Camera controls
>> Colony movement
>> Colony priorities management
>> Resource gathering
>> Building new colonies
##tutorial1.your_colony
This is your colony, it's quite autonomous.
It operates according to its priorities.
Drones are its flesh and blood.
They gather resources, defend it, evolve
and circle around all the time!
##tutorial1.action_cards.keyboard
You can change the selected colony priorities
by choosing one of the action cards.
Try activating them. You can use a left mouse click
on them or press a hotkey: 1-5 or Q-T.
##tutorial1.action_cards.gamepad
You can change the selected colony priorities
by choosing one of the action cards.
To activate a card, press Y, B, A or X.
The card icons resemble the associated button.
##tutorial1.resources_priority
The resources priority makes your colony
workers gather resources more often.
Try increasing it by choosing an appropriate card.
##tutorial1.growth_priority
The growth priority affects drones production
and buildings construction rate.
Try increasing it by choosing an appropriate card.
##tutorial1.evolution_priority
The evolution priority is needed to make
tier 1 drones combine into something more powerful.
You'll learn more about that during the next mission.
Try increasing it by choosing an appropriate card.
##tutorial1.security_priority
The security priority increases the number
of combat units your colony wants to have.
It also affects some combat-related behaviors.
Try increasing it by choosing an appropriate card.
##tutorial1.camera.keyboard
You can pan the camera by using arrow keys.
The mouse scrolling works near the camera edges
or when you're holding the middle mouse button.
Locate a resource stash by following a marker.
##tutorial1.camera.gamepad
You can pan the camera by using D-pad buttons.
Alternatively, the left joystick should work too.
Locate a resource stash by following a marker.
##tutorial1.move.keyboard
In order to move, do a right mouse click
on a destination spot.
The colony will fly towards the spot,
but its max jump distance is limited.
##tutorial1.move.gamepad
When using a gamepad, you will need to
use a virtual cursor that is controlled
by the right joystick. Select a destination
point and click the right joystick button.
The colony will fly towards the spot,
but its max jump distance is limited.
##tutorial1.fill_resources
Fill your colony resource pool
above the middle.
Keep in mind that your colony needs
to be close to the resources to collect them.
##tutorial1.build_action
When ready, build a new colony by using a
"build new colony" grey action card.
##tutorial1.base_construction
A new base construction is scheduled!
It will require some time and resources.
Your colony should be nearby to
complete the construction.
##tutorial1.finish_construction
To complete this mission, finish the
construction of a new colony.
##tutorial1.resource_bar
The yellow bar on your colony
is a resource pool. It's full if
all three segments are filled.
##tutorial1.hint_worker
This is a tier 1 worker drone.
It performs most of the basic tasks,
like resource gathering.
##tutorial1.hint_scout
This is a tier 1 combat drone,
a scout model. It will defend the
base against any attackers.

##tutorial.title2 : Tutorial 2 - Factions and Evolution
##tutorial.description2
Learning topics:

>> Faction bonuses
>> Drones evolition via merging
>> Drone special abilities
##tutorial2.factions_first_choice
The first four action cards have an
additional feature we were ignoring previously.
Pick a green card to make us started.
##tutorial2.factions_second_choice
Apart from priorities, a colony
has factions distribution.
You change the distribution by choosing
an action card of the same color.
Pick another card of any faction.
##tutorial2.faction_drone
The faction distribution determines
a chance of a new drone to have a
specific faction series assigned to it.
Every faction has its own bonuses.
##tutorial2.yellow_faction
Let's learn the faction bonuses one by one.
We'll start from the yellow faction.
Acquire at least one drone of that series.
##tutorial2.yellow_faction_done
The yellow faction drones are the best
resource collectors, thanks to the extended cargo.
They also have the highest energy recovery rate.
Now to the red faction.
##tutorial2.red_faction_done
The red faction drones make the best
combat units. They get a great
durability bonus. Red units also evolve into
the most deadly tier 2 drones.
Now to the green faction.
##tutorial2.green_faction_done
The green faction drones are engineers.
The engineers move, construct
and repair buildings faster.
Now to the blue faction.
##tutorial2.blue_faction_done
The blue faction gets a significant max energy
bonus, meaning they're capable of doing
more tasks before discharging.
They also increase the evolution points gain rate.
##tutorial2.recycle_drones
For the next turorial step, I will
reset your faction priorities and
recycle most of your drones.
##tutorial2.request_cloner
Now let's try something new.
Create a cloner class drone via evolution.
You'll need one red faction worker and
one blue faction combat unit.
##tutorial2.cloner_ability
When two tier 1 drones of specific factions merge,
a new tier 2 drone is produced.
Most tier 2 drones have special abilities.
A cloner drone can make copies of other drones.
##tutorial2.tier3_intro
Two tier 2 drones combine into a next tier.
The evolution points are also needed for that
to happen. They're generated by your colony
if its evolution priority is high enough.
##tutorial2.recipe_hint.keyboard
You can toggle the drone merge table
by pressing ALT key.
##tutorial2.recipe_hint.gamepad
You can toggle the drone merge table
by pressing R2 key.
##tutorial2.request_destroyer
To complete this mission, create a destroyer
class drone by merging two fighter class drones.
A fighter drone is created by combining
a red combat drone with a green combat drone.
##tutorial2.evo_points
You acquired two fighter drones.
Now you need to collect enough evolution points.
The evolution points level is indicated by
a colored diode on your colony.
When it's blue, a tier 3 drone can be produced.
##tutorial2.destroyer_ability
A destroyer drone is one of the most powerful
tier 3 combat units. You'll have a chance of
using it in your next tutorial mission.

##tutorial.title3 : Tutorial 3 - Combat
##tutorial.description3
Learning topics:

>> Building security drones army
>> Base defence against spawning enemies
>> Offensive actions
>> Controlling multiple bases
##tutorial3.base_select.keyboard
This time you start with two colonies.
You can select a different colony by
left-clicking it or pressing a TAB button.
##tutorial3.base_select.gamepad
This time you start with two colonies.
You can select a different colony by
clicking on it with your virtual cursor
or by pressing R1.
##tutorial3.base_controls
When choosing an action card,
it's applied to the selected colony.
Every colony has a separate factions
distribution and priorities.
Try moving either of your colonies.
##tutorial3.shared_actions
While one of your colonies is moving, you might
want to switch back to your other colony.
You will find out that action cooldown is shared.
Choose wisely.
##tutorial3.enemy_drone
An enemy drone is approaching your colony.
Get ready for some combat.
##tutorial3.locate_base
The drone you defeated was created by an
enemy base. These bases become more
dangerous over time.
Locate that base to continue.
##tutorial3.attack_action
You have an access to new grey action cards.
Attack card makes your combat drones charge
at the nearby enemy targets.
##tutorial3.radius_action
The radius-related actions affect
the colony influence radius. Higher radius
means more drones and territory,
but it can make your formations more vulnerable.
Lower radius also makes evolution faster.
##tutorial3.final_goal
To complete this mission,
you need to destroy the enemy base.
Apply everything you've learned so far.
##tutorial3.hint_freighter
You acquired a freighter!
Freighters carry much more resources
compared to many other drones.
##tutorial3.hint_servobot
You acquired a servobot!
Every servo drone in a colony
increases its movement speed
as well as the max jump distance.
##tutorial3.hint_repairbot
You acquired a repairbot!
As the name suggests, repairbots will
restore the damaged drones.

##tutorial.title4 : Tutorial 4 - The Final Challenge
##tutorial.description4
Learning topics:

>> Red crystals and oil gathering
>> Elite drones production
>> Radar
>> Avoiding and defeating the enemy colony
##tutorial4.locate_boss
Welcome to your final tutorial mission.
This time, it's as close to the actual
classic game mode as it gets.
There is an enemy colony on this map.
Locate it by following the marker.
##tutorial4.radar
Have you noticed the radar in the
bottom-left corner of the screen?
It can be used to locate the enemy colony
and predict its movement.
##tutorial4.boss_warning
You should never face the enemy colony
face-to-face unless you're prepared
for an ultimate clash.
Use your radar to move out of its way
if you're not ready yet to battle it.
##tutorial4.red_crystals
Let's utilize a new resource type.
The red crystals allow your base
to produce elite drones.
Collect some to see it for yourself.
##tutorial4.elite_drone
This is an elite drone.
It has most of its base stats improved.
The red crystals are accessible, but
they're not the best source of elites.
##tutorial4.red_miner_request
In order to show you a better way,
we'll need to produce a new drone.
Combine a yellow and red worker
to get it.
##tutorial4.red_miner_done
You acquired a red miner!
This is the only drone that can
harvest the red oil resource.
##tutorial4.red_oil
To make use of that red miner,
get closer to the red oil source.
The red oil is superior to the red
crystals due to its vast capacity.
##tutorial4.final_goal
Continue to evolve your base
and perhaps build a second one
if you haven't yet.
Your end goal of this mission
is to defeat the enemy colony!
##tutorial4.hint_superelite
When two elite drones combine,
a super elite can emerge.
