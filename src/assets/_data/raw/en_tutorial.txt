##tutorial.title1 : Tutorial 1 - Basic Colony Operations
##tutorial.description1
Learning topics:

> Camera controls
> Colony movement
> Colony priorities management
> Resource gathering
> Building new colonies
##tutorial1.your_colony
This is your colony, it's quite autonomous.
It operates according to its priorities.
Try moving it by using a right click
on the destination.
##tutorial1.action_cards.keyboard
You can change the selected colony priorities
by choosing one of the behavior cards.
Try activating them. You can use a left mouse click
on them or press a hotkey: 1-5 or Q-T.
##tutorial1.resources_priority
The resources priority makes your colony
workers gather resources more often.
Building a base requires a bunch of resources.
Try increasing it by choosing an appropriate card.
##tutorial1.growth_priority
The growth priority affects drones production
and buildings construction rate.
Try increasing it by choosing an appropriate card.
##tutorial1.evolution_priority
The evolution priority is needed to make
the tier 1 drones combine into something more powerful.
You'll learn more about that during the next mission.
Try increasing it by choosing an appropriate card.
##tutorial1.security_priority
The security priority increases the number
of combat units your colony has.
It also affects some combat-related behaviors.
Try increasing it by choosing an appropriate card.
##tutorial1.camera.keyboard
You can pan the camera by using the arrow keys.
The mouse scrolling works near the camera edges
or when you're holding the middle mouse button.
Locate the best resource stash on this map.
##tutorial1.fill_resources
The yellow bar on your colony is a resource pool.
Try to fill it above the middle.
Keep in mind that your colony needs
to be close to the resources to collect them.
##tutorial1.build_action
When ready, build a new colony by using a
"build new colony" grey action card.
##tutorial1.base_construction
A new base construction is scheduled!
It will require some time and resources.
Your colony should be nearby to
complete the construction.
##tutorial1.finish_construction
To complete this mission, finish the
construction of a new colony.

##tutorial.title2 : Tutorial 2 - Factions and Evolution
##tutorial.description2
Learning topics:

> Faction bonuses
> Drones evolition via merging
> Drone special abilities
##tutorial2.factions_first_choice
The first four action cards have an
additional feature we were ignoring previously.
Pick a green card to make us started.
##tutorial2.factions_second_choice
Apart from priorities, a colony
has factions distribution.
You change the distribution by choosing
an action card of the same color.
Pick another card of any faction.
##tutorial2.faction_drone
The faction distribution determines
a chance of a new drone to have a
specific faction series assigned to it.
Every faction has its own bonuses.
##tutorial2.yellow_faction
Let's learn the faction bonuses one by one.
We'll start from the yellow faction.
Acquire at least one drone of that series.
##tutorial2.yellow_faction_done
The yellow faction drones are the best
resource collecting workers. They also
have the highest energy recovery rate.
Now to the red faction.
##tutorial2.red_faction_done
The red faction drones make the best
combat units. They get a great
durability bonus. Red units also evolve into
the most deadly tier 2 drones.
Now to the green faction.
##tutorial2.green_faction_done
The green faction drones are engineers.
The engineers move, construct
and repair buildings faster.
Now to the blue faction.
##tutorial2.blue_faction_done
The blue faction gets a significant max energy
bonus, meaning they're capable of doing
more tasks before discharging.
They also increase the evolution points gain rate.
##tutorial2.recycle_drones
For the next turorial step, I will
reset your faction priorities and
recycle most of your drones.
##tutorial2.request_cloner
Now let's try something new.
Create a cloner class drone via evolution.
You'll need one red faction worker and
one blue faction combat unit.
##tutorial2.cloner_ability
When two tier 1 drones of specific factions merge,
a new tier 2 drone is produced.
Most tier 2 drones have special abilities.
A cloner drone can make copies of other drones.
##tutorial2.tier3_intro
Two tier 2 drones combine into a next tier.
The evolution points are also needed for that
to happen. They're generated by your colony
if its evolution priority is high enough.
##tutorial2.request_destroyer
To complete this mission, create a destroyer
class drone by merging two fighter class drones.
A fighter drone is created by combining
a red combat drone with a green combat drone.
##tutorial2.evo_points
You acquired two fighter drones.
Now you need to collect enough evolution points.
The evolution points level is indicated by
a colored diode on your colony.
When it's blue, a tier 3 drone can be produced.
##tutorial2.destroyer_ability
A destroyer drone is one of the most powerful
tier 3 combat units. You'll have a chance of
using it in your next tutorial mission.

##tutorial.title3 : Tutorial 3 - Combat
##tutorial.description3
Learning topics:

> Building security drones army
> Base defence against spawning enemies
> Offensive actions
> Controlling multiple bases
##tutorial3.base_select.keyboard
This time you start with two colonies.
You can select a different colony by
left-clicking it or pressing a TAB button.
##tutorial3.base_controls
When choosing an action card,
it's applied to the selected colony.
Every colony has a separate factions
distribution and priorities.
Try moving either of your colonies.
##tutorial3.shared_actions
While one of your colonies is moving, you might
want to switch back to your other colony.
You will find out that action cooldown is shared.
Choose wisely.
##tutorial3.enemy_drone
An enemy drone is approaching your colony.
Get ready for some combat.
##tutorial3.locate_base
The drone you defeated was created by an
enemy base. These bases become more
dangerous over time.
Locate that base to continue.
##tutorial3.attack_action
You have an access to new grey action cards.
Attack card makes your combat drones charge
at the nearby enemy targets.
##tutorial3.radius_action
The radius-related actions affect
the colony influence radius. Higher radius
means more drones and territory,
but it can make your formations more vulnerable.
##tutorial3.final_goal
To complete this mission,
you need to destroy the enemy base.
Apply everything you've learned so far.
##tutorial3.hint_freighter
You acquired a freighter!
Freighters carry much more resources
compared to many other drones.
##tutorial3.hint_servobot
You acquired a servobot!
Every servo drone in a colony
increases its movement speed
as well as the max jump distance.
##tutorial3.hint_repairbot
You acquired a repairbot!
As the name suggests, repairbots will
restore the damaged drones.
